                <h3>Wind Light</h3>
                <p><strong>Edition: 100</strong></p>
                <p>Wind Light is a one-of-a-kind, unique designer lamp.</p>
                <p>Its form is inspired by the forces of nature: wind, gravity and the interaction between molecules of matter. It is the physical embodiment of an intangible, digital sensation.</p>
                <p>The poetic designer lamp is produced in a limited edition, yet each example is unique. <br>
                   In designing it, I was looking for an answer to the question: how might we leverage the characteristics of 3D printing to our advantage in a collectible design object?

                <h3>LetThereBe Light</h3>
                <p><strong>Edition: 1/1</strong></p>
                <p>For LetThereBe Light, our design team wanted to evoke a sense of sacrality through electronics.</p>
                <p>The luminaire combines the functions of both candleholder and mood lighting: it uses its built-in digital camera to monitor the candle flame and electronically multiplies it.</p>
                <p>The mesmerising play of the flame is projected in real time onto the wall, creating an elevated yet cosy atmosphere.</p>
