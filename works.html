                <p><strong>Edition: 100</strong></p>
                <p>Wind Light is a one-of-a-kind, unique designer lamp.
                <p>Its form is inspired by the forces of nature: wind, gravity and the interaction between molecules of matter. It is the physical embodiment of an intangible, digital sensation.</p>
                <p>The poetic designer lamp is produced in a limited edition, yet each example is unique. <br>
                   In designing it, I was looking for an answer to the question: how might we leverage the characteristics of 3D printing to our advantage in a collectible design object?
